# Steam-Game-Recording-Compiler
Compiles the .m4s to .mp4 in SteamOS Game Recording


Step by step guide:

1. Download the Compiler.sh
2. Open Konsole in steamdeck and go to the directory where you put the Compiler.sh

```
#example if you saved it in Downloads Folder
cd Downloads

```

3. Once in the directory, run:

```sh
chmod +x Compiler.sh
bash Compiler.sh
```

Reminder to not run any bash file from the internet. Check the code first.


4. It will ask for the directory it should be pretty similar to this:
```sh
home/deck/.steam/steam/userdata/<random_id_number>/gamerecordings/clip/clip_*/video/fg_*
```

5. Wait for the code to finish its thing.
6. You can find the video named "final_video" on the same folder on step 4.
